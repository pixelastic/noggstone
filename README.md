The goal of this repo is to create a simple blind test app where one has to
guess the card that makes a specific noise when coming into play.

This will be a good exercice in extracting HearthStone data.

## Note

I currently play HearthStone on my Android Tablet, but as it is hearder to
extract from an apk than it is from a Desktom app, I'm currently using the OSX
install files, given by a friend.
